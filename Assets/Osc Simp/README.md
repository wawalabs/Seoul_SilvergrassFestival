# Osc Simpl

An Open Sound Control (OSC) implementation tailored for Unity and designed for those who love the flexibility of scripting. OSC is a protocol for communicating between applications and devices easily using URL-style messages with mixed argument types. It is widely used in "creative coding‚Äù, music, and VJ contexts, but also has potential as a general-purpose networking tool.

Documentation is found in the sub folder '/Documentation'. To get started, import the examples (using the Package Mannager Window) and dive in.
